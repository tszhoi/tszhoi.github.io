				<h1> Enjoying the ride - 2021 Year In Review </h1>
				<p> Dec 30, 2021</p> <br>
			</div>

			<div class="intro">
				<br>
				<p> I’m never into new year’s resolutions, but I’m a fan of reviews and reflections. A lot happened in 2021, 
					to a point where I feel like writing a blog about it. Found it too long writing in chronological, 
					so I’m writing down some of the significant learnings that I’ve experienced, learned throughout the year. 
					<br><br>
					1. Take care of your body and your mind. <br> I had a difficult start in 2021 with the covid lockdown and travel restriction. Living along in lockdown without knowing when I can go home was dreadful. My productivity for work keeps dropping, feeling devastated with daily life. I was trying hard to come up with a formula or routine to make myself feel better, 
				hence, motivated with life. Black Coffee, Radio, Zoom, Long walk, Read in the park, Running, 
				Online game with friends.To be honest, besides video games, I didn’t do any of those before. 
				But soon enough I love doing those every day cause it makes me feel great, even in difficult times.
