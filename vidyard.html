                <h2 class="text-slate-800 text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4 border-t pt-4">Context</h2>

                <p class="mb-6">In early 2024, we launched Vidyard Home as an experiment for the Free workspace tier, aiming to test <span class="text-highlight-blue"> how a centralised starting point could enhance user engagement. </span> Despite being built and shipped in just 6 short weeks, the experiment achieved a<span class="text-highlight-blue"> 12% improvement in retention</span>, showcasing its potential impact. </p>
                      
                <p class="mb-10"> As a video recording tool for B2B sales, Vidyard serves a diverse user base, from individual 
                  Free and Pro accounts to large-scale Plus and Enterprise teams. Building on the experiment’s success, 
                  we were on a mission to design a scalable, holistic experience that <span class="text-highlight-blue">shows the right content to the 
                  right user at the right time</span>—supporting users from their first sign-up to the “aha moment” of becoming deeply engaged customers.</p>
                
                 <h2 class="text-slate-800 text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4 border-t pt-4">Zooming Out Before Moving Forward</h2>
                <p>While the experimental MVP design had proven effective, scaling Vidyard Home required addressing a series of broader questions as it is longer serve one type of customers:</p>
                <figure class="mb-6 mt-6">
                  <img src="images/vyblog/visual2.png" alt="Key Visual for the Blog" class="rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-100">
              </figure>
              
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-800 font-semibold mt-6">
                    <li class="mb-2">Who are we designing for? What are their daily workflows, and how does Vidyard fit in?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Where are they in their engagement cycle? What’s the key action we want them to take next?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">What’s the purpose of each component? How should it guide users through Vidyard’s ecosystem?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">What does the data and feedback tell us? What opportunities for improvement have emerged?</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">What’s our timeline and scope? How can we deliver effectively while mitigating risks?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-10 mt-6"> Returning to the drawing board, we created flow charts and mapped out user journeys to ensure every aspect of the Home page was purposeful, impactful and scalable. </p>

                <!-- Solution -->
                <h2 class="text-slate-800 text-2xl font-medium mt-8 mb-4 border-t pt-4">Overcoming Challenges</h2>
                <p class="mb-6 mt-6">The primary challenge was designing a centralised experience that seamlessly catered to <span class="text-highlight-blue"> both self-serve small teams and complex, multi-layered enterprise workspaces,</span> each with distinct systems and setups.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6"> This challenge was further heightened by Vidyard’s evolution into a multi-product platform, with offerings like Rooms, Prospector, Video Hosting, Video Messaging, and AI Avatars—all competing for user attention. Ensuring that Vidyard Home remained focused and purposeful was critical to <span class="text-highlight-blue">avoid it becoming a “dumping ground” </span> for these competing priorities, which could dilute its effectiveness and user impact.</p>
                
                <p> After aligning with the Product and dev team, we soon found the goals of our solution:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-slate-800 font-semibold mt-3"></ul>
                    <li class="mb-2">A centralised Home experience where upgraded users don't find confusing anymore</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Quick access to Vidyard’s wide-range of products and important features</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Personalised recommendations guiding users toward feature adoption</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">An overview of recent and top team activities to motivate users stay engaged</li>
                    <li class="mb-10">Additionally, surfacing training resources and marketing materials to support new users</li>
                </ul>

                  <p class="mb-6">Adding <span class="font-semibold">Call-to-Action (CTA) cards</span> to improve feature discoverability. These cards provided immediate access to Vidyard’s core features, addressing gaps in the MVP where users struggled to explore the platform’s offerings.</p>
